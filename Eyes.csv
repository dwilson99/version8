GB1475260,"Imitation eyes","1475260 Toys eyes REAL SOFT TOYS Ltd 22 Dec 1975 52501/75 Heading A6S A toy eye for use in a toy animal such as a cat comprises a translucent head 1 shaped to simulate at least the normally visible part of the eyeball and a spigot 2 projecting rearwardly from the rear side of the head. The spigot 2 is nearly oval over at least a part of its length having shallow recesses 2b 2b and slightly deeper adjacent recesses 2c 2c shaped as shown adjacent the rear of the head 1. An annular roughened zone 1f at the rear face le of the head 1 is formed during moulding of the eye which is made of plastics. The rear face 2a of the spigot is painted black. Viewed from the front the eye shows a partly closed pupil 1g surrounded by an iris 1b and parts of the eyeball 1i. Reference is made to Specification 1452595.","**WARNING** start of CLMS field may overlap end of DESC **. 
 The illustrated imitation eye consists of a single piece of moulded translucent colourless or tinted plastics material. This could be an acrylic polymer such as polymethyl methacrylate, possibly that supplied in powder form by I.C.I. under the name ""DIAKON"" (a registered trade mark), or polystyrene crystal or crystalline polystyrene, or polythene, for example that sold by <RTIgt;I.C.I.</RTI>  under the name ""ULTRATHENE"" (a registered trade mark). It consists of a head portion 1 shaped to simulate part of an eye, including the normally visible part of the eyeball, and a spigot 2 projecting rearwardly from the rear side, which is planar, of the head portion 1.The head portion 1 has a first part la which is a simulation of part of an eyeball and a second --part <RTIgt;ib</RTI>  and a third part <RTIgt;lc</RTI>  which are on opposite sides of the part la and are simulations of an upper eyelid and a lower eyelid, respectively. The parts Ib and <RTIgt;lc</RTI>  could be painted, for example black. As regards these parts la to <RTIgt;lc</RTI>  and the spigot, attention is directed to the claims of ourApplication No. 1,452,595. The spigot 2 is of circular cross-section over the greater part of its length and at its free end 2a it has a flat circular surface perpendicular to the axis of the spigot and covered all over with polyethylene-derived or polystyrenederived paint of an appropriate colour in this case black.The imitation eye is to be secured in a model or toy cat using aSimmons fastener, which consists of a ring, which is to encircle the spigot 2, provided with a ring of inwardly directed teeth which are to grip the spigot.
 A short distance from the root of the spigot there is a recess 2b in each of two opposite sides of the spigot, the recesses being such that the cross-section of the spigot here has a shape which is nearly an oval, but is more pointed at both ends, like the pupil of a cat&apos;s eye when partly closed.
Each recess 2b adjoins another recess 2c which is deeper than the recess 2b, the two recesses in effect forming a single recess.
The cross-section of the spigot at the position of the recesses 2c also has a shape which is nearly an oval, but is more pointed at both ends. Considering any plane containing the axis of the spigot, the part of the spigot where the recesses 2c are formed does not project further from the axis of the spigot than does the part of the spigot where the recesses 2b are formed. The recesses 2c are bounded at the left hand side (considering Figure 4) by a plane surface which is a continuation of the plane surface le at the rear of the head portion 1 of the artificial eye. Surrounding the root of the spigot is an annular area <RTIgt;lf</RTI>  of this plane surface which is somewhat rough or undulating by virtue of an annular area of the mould, in which the artificial eye was formed, having been, after its manufacture with the desired shape, roughened by a spark-erosion process.
 When the artificial eye is viewed from the front, one can see a black area <RTIgt;1g</RTI>  approximately corresponding in shape to the crosssection of the spigot at the position of the recesses 2b and this appears to be surrounded by a paler annular area <RTIgt;lh,</RTI>  corresponding to the area lf, which in turn appears to be surrounded by an area li which is still paler, the whole impression being of a cat&apos;s eye consisting of a partly closed pupil (area <RTIgt;lg),</RTI>  an iris (area lh) surrounding it and the remainder of the normally visible part of the eyeball (area li).
 WHAT WE CLAIM IS:
 1. An imitation eye suitable for use as part of a model feline or a toy feline, the imitation eye comprising a translucent head portion shaped to simulate at least the <RTIgt;normally</RTI>  visible part of the eyeball and a spigot projecting rearwardly from the rear side of the head portion, the spigot being of nearly oval cross-section, like the pupil of a feline&apos;s eye when partly closed, over at least part of its length.
 2. An imitation eye according to claim 1 having paint applied all over the free end of the spigot, the paint being of a contrasting colour as compared with the spigot, which is translucent.
 3. An imitation eye according to claim 1 or 2 in which the cross-section of the spigot is circular over the whole of its length except a part near the rear side of the head portion, where the cross-section is nearly an oval, as described above, over a short length of the spigot.
 4. An imitation eye according to claim 3 in which said short length is not immediately adjacent the rear face of the head portion, there being a thinner part of the spigot joining this short length to the head portion, this thinner part not extending further from the axis of the spigot than does said short length of the spigot in any plane containing the axis of the spigot.
  5. An imitation eye suitable for use as part of a model animal or a toy animal comprising a translucent head portion shaped to simulate at least the normally visible part of the eyeball and a spigot projecting rearwardly from the rear side of the head portion, the rear side of the head portion including an annular area, surrounding the  
root of the spigot, where the surface is rough by virtue of the imitation eye having been cast in a mould of which the surface has been roughened at its part correspond ing to said area, the result being that said annular area looks like an iris when the imitation eye is viewed from the front.
 6. An imitation eye according to claim 5 and any one of claims 1 to 4.
 7. An imitation eye suitable for use as part of a model feline or a toy feline, substantially as described above with reference to the accompanying drawing.",446389000,A63H0003380000,A63H00338000
