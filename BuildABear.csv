GB1016228,"Wheel alignment apparatus","1016228. Aligning vehicle wheels. BEAR MANUFACTURING CO. Dec. 171963 [Dec. 18 1962] No. 49717/63. Heading G1X. Apparatus for determining the toe-in or toe out of the front wheels 8 of a vehicle comprises an adaptor 12 fixed to each wheel 8 coaxially thereof when in position support plates 14 depending from each adaptor 12 a bar 16 carried by the support plates 14 on each adaptor so as to be parallel to the respective wheel 8 a pair of brackets 38 mounted on each bar and a spring pressed rod 18 mounted on each bracket at right angles to the bar and adapted to be yieldingly biased against the wheel 8 to retain the bar parallel thereto. The adaptor 12 is magnetically held on the wheel spindle and may also carry a gauge 28 to check castor or camber. A measuring rod 20 is provided and has an adjustable scale 44 thereon lockable by a wing fastener (not shown). Pairs of guide pins 41 are mounted adjacent each end of each bar 16 beyond the periphery of the wheels 8 and the rod 20 is received between the pins of each pair. Each bar 16 also carries two spaced pins 34 with aligned sighting holes for sighting a target (not shown) which is adapted to be placed against the rear wheel of the vehicle. In use with the apparatus in position a sighting is made on each target through the holes in the pins 34 and with the target in view the rods 18 are locked to the bar 16 by wing fasteners (not shown) the rods being in abutment with the wheel 8. The wheels are moved until the target readings are the same on both sides of the vehicle. The rod 20 is placed on the bars 16 either behind or in front of the wheels 8 the rod 20 having a rectangular notch or its underside at the end remote from the scale 44 to engage with one of the bars 16. The scale 44 is set with its zero mark in line with marks on top of the pins 41 and the rod 20 then moved to the position in front of or behind the wheels 8 respectively. The reading of the scale 44 enables the toe-in or toe out of the wheels 8 to be determined. The wheels 8 may be positioned on a turning radius gauge 47 if desired.","**WARNING** start of CLMS field may overlap end of DESC **.
 rear wheel 49, each target having an integralV-shaped handle portion 50 for abutment with the outer edge of the respective wheel.
Each <RTIgt;target</RTI>  48 has a plurality of equally spaced, vertical lines 51 which are used for <RTIgt;obtaining</RTI>  an alignment reading from the sight pins 34 relative to the front wheel un the <RTIgt;sam</RTI>  side of the vehicle, as will be hereinafter explained. In using the apparatus of the invention, each of the front wheels is <RTIgt;pre-</RTI>  ferably, <RTIgt;through</RTI>  not necessarily, positioned upon a turning radius gauge 47, designed to provide a rotatable table so that the wheel supported thereby may be swung from sideto-side into a generally straight ahead position for checking wheel toe-in or toe-out and center position. The apparatus 6 is mounted on both front wheels <RTIgt;cf</RTI>  the vehicle, and the targets 48 are placed in position at the rear wheels, all as shown in Figure 1.
 A sighting is made on each target <RTIgt;4n</RTI>  <RTIgt;thcough</RTI>  the sighting <RTIgt;holes</RTI>  36 in <RTIgt;the</RTI>  pins 34 on the bar 16 on the respective side of the vehicle. If the target is not visible the bar 16 is adjusted so that the target will be visible when viewed through the sighting holes.
When such condition is realized, the bar 16 on each side of the vehicle is fixed in position by locking the support rods 18 in abutment against the wheel 8. The wheels 8 are then <RTIgt;swung</RTI>  back and forth as need be until the target readings are the same on both sides of the vehicle when the front portions of th.e wheels ace spread by pushing lightly outward on both wheels simultaneously.
 The <RTIgt;measuring</RTI>  rod 20 is then slid under the vehicle, from either side of the vehicle, rearwardly of the front wheels, the rod being manipulated by the operator <RTIgt;from</RTI>  the scale end of the rod. The operator then lifts the rod to place the notched end thereof between the rearward pair of guide pins 41 on the far side of the vehicle and shifts the rod longitudinally to cause the notch 43 to align and seatably engage with the respective bar 16. The operator then places the scale end of the bar between the rearward pair of pins on the bar 16 adjacent to him, whereby the measuring rod is operatively associated <RTIgt;with</RTI>  the reference bars 16 without necessity for the operator going from side-to-side of the vehicle. The scale 44 is then adjusted so that the zero mark of the scale coincides with the indicator lines 42 on the adjacent guide pins 41, and the scale is locked in said position. The measuring rod <RTIgt;20</RTI>  is then removed from the rearward ends of the <RTIgt;cefer-</RTI>  ence bars (again from one side of the vehicle) and placed atop the bars (in the same manner) forwardly of the wheels 8. If the zero mark <RTIgt;cn</RTI>  the measuring rod scale 44 is outside (relative to the vehicle) the indicator lines 42 on the now adjacent guide pins 41, the front wheels have toe-in; if the zero mark is <RTIgt;aligned</RTI>  with the indicator lines 42, the wheels have no toe-in or toe-out; and if the zero mark is inside the indicator line, the front wheels have toe-out. The scale 44 will show the exact amount of toe-in or toe-out, which is then checked with vehicle manufacturers&apos; specifications. <RTIgt;Also,</RTI>  the operator will now check <RTIgt;te</RTI>  see if the steering <RTIgt;wheel</RTI>  in the driver compartment of the vehicle is in centered, straight ahead steering position. Such adjustments as may be necessary are readily effected by automotive mechanics, and other persons skilled in the art, and need not be discussed herein. As will be obvious, the apparatus of the invention can be retained in position and used to assist in and secure the proper results of any correction procedure.
