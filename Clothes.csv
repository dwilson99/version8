After so positioning the adhesive strips 14, the child rubs the red lined indicia 21 with a suitable implement, such as a household spoon. The applied pressure joins the adhesive strips 18 to the cloth patterns 23 and 35. The resulting arrangement is shown clearly in Figure 4.
  After positioning the adhesive strips 18 and firmly pressuring same, the child may use a pair of scissors 36 to cut the patterns 23 and from the sheet material 22, as indicated in Figure 4. This results in the complete bolero 24 and purse 26 shown in Figure 5.
  Having successfully cut the cloth to the desired configuration, the child then grasps the tab sections 20 of the adhesive strips 18 on the bolero 24 and removes strips 18 therefrom at the areas of edge joinder. Typical removal of one strip 18 is shown in Figure 6. The imprinted joinder indicia 28, 28 and 30, 30 will then be exposed and, because the cloth 22 has a rougher textured surface than the strips 18, the adhesive 19 which formerly adhered to the strip 18 has now been transferred to the joinder areas 28, 28 and 30, 30.
  To complete the bolero 24, it is only necessary for the child to fold the incomplete bolero 24 so that the areas of joinder having similar indicia are firmly brought into engagement, as illustrated in Figure 7 for the indicia 28, 28. The contact adhesive 19 now on the bolero 24 provides a relatively permanent attachment for the areas of joinder. The virtually completed bolero article is shown in Figure 7. After completion, the bolero of Figure 7 is reversed to externally expose the decoration 24a and position the joined areas internally thereof.
  To compleete the purse 26, openings 37 are provided in the decorations 26b, the edge areas 32 and 34 are folded inwardly on top of the underside 38 of the purse 26 and the paper strips 18 are removed leaving adhesive 19 adhered to the purse 26. The purse is then centrally folded with the decorations 26a and 26b on the outside and the edge areas 32, 32 and 34, 34 are pressure joined as indicated for areas 32, 32 in Figure 8. A drawstring 40 is then threaded through the openings 37.
  It will thus be apparent to those skilled in the art that the disclosed invention provides a unique mode for home manufacture of articles of wearing apparel that is particularly adapted for use by children of tender years.
  The particular utility to the child of the adhesive packaged in the paper strips with the red locating indicia 21 will be apparent. In addition to child usefulness, this mode of packaging provides long shelf life without adhesive deterioration. The simplicity of the disclosed invention as well as the high quality of the wearing apparel which is so easily produced, offers great satisfaction to the child and conse1,069,222 4.106,2 vided interposed between and joining elements of paper.
  9. A method of manufacture as claimed in claim 8, and including imprinting indicia along said edge area for visually indicating areas of subsequent joinder.
  10. A method of manufacture as claimed in claim 9 and including the step of imprinting indicia on one of said paper elements to facilitate the subsequent application of said adhesive material to said edge areas.
  11. A method of manufacturing an article of doll&apos;s apparel, comprising, providing a sheet of cloth material, imprinting a predetermind pattern on said cloth material, said pattern being adapted for the cutting of a segment of said cloth material from said sheet, imprinting indicia on edge areas of said pattern segment to visually indicate the areas of subsequent joinder, providing contact-type adhesive interposed between two paper elements, separating the paper elements so that the contacttype adhesive adheres to one of said elements, providing on said one element other indicia to indicate the area of ahderence of said contacttype adhesive thereto, positioning said one element with the second indicia aligned with said first mentioned indicia along said edge areas, applying pressure to said one element to induce the transfer of said adhesive from said one element to the edge areas, and after removing said one element abutting the edge areas and applying pressure thereto to induce joinder thereof and thereby form said article of apparel.
  12. An article of manufacture adapted for subsequent home production of doll wearing apparel, substantially as herein described with reference to the accompanying drawings.
  13. A method of making an article of doll&apos;s apparel substantially as herein described.
